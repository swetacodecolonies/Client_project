                <p> <em class="txt-danger fw-bold">Smart headphones</em> — also called smart earbuds or hearable — are
                    high-tech in-ear devices that do more than transmit audio. These headphones are usually wireless,
                    and they can sync up with your phone, tablet, computer or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The main
                    appeal of hearables is convenience, as they allow you to complete common tasks without directly
                    accessing your phone or computer. Smart wireless headphones sync up to other devices using Bluetooth
                    technology, and many of their features rely on data from your smartphone or computer.
